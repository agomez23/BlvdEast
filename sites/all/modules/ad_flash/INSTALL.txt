INSTALLATION

 Due to the need for some extra elements to get this module working, and some of
these elements not falling under the relevant licences, it is not possible to 
include them for download within this module.

• Visit http://www.adobe.com/devnet/activecontent/articles/devletter.html
• Scroll down to ‘Requirements’ and download the sample archive.
• Create a subdirectory inside the ad_flash directory, called ‘scripts’.
• Extract AC_ActiveX.js and AC_RunActiveContent.js into this directory. The
  paths to these files should be ad_flash/scripts/AC_ActiveX.js and
  ad_flash/scripts/AC_RunActiveContent.js.

Because of licence issues, flash video (FLV) content is not supported at the
moment.
Dependecies:
