Taxonomies can be imported from external service providers and locations.
A few samples are built-in, and more can be provided by additional modules.
Most supported services are direct URL requests, usually with an identifier in the GET string indicating the entry being requested.
Others are simply URLs (no ID argument needed) where a third-party document can be downloaded from, provided as a convenience, or to avoid licensing problems, and to ensure you are retrieving the latest version.

Two forms of 'service' are currently supported - search and lookup.

Search is intended to take a text string and return a resource ID relevant to the service provider. 
Each service has its own form of local ID.

Lookup is used when you have uniquely identified the resource entry to be retrieved, and returns a machine-readable dump of that data in one of the supported formats.

The service definition array is undergoing development
