IM_raw.module

This module allows you to enter ImageMagick command line options as an imagecache action. ImageAPI 5.x-1.3 or higher is required.

Take a look at http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/ to get an idea of the sort of things you can do.

There's a permission that will deny users the ability to access the form to edit the commands, so check the permission is enabled for any role you want to have access.
