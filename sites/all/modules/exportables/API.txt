API for Exportables 1.x for Drupal 6
===========================

*hook_exportables()*
---------------------------
Returns a keyed array of information about a type of exportable. Keys:

- hook name: The name of the hook which defines the in-code items.
- load function: The function which loads items by ID.
- save function: Function to save the object.
- load all function: The function which returns an array of all valid items.
- update function: Function to update in-db definition of the object. Defaults to save function if none specified.
- delete function: Function to delete the object from the database.
- id property: The property of the object defining it's ID.
- title property: The property of the object defining it's title, from which the machine readable name is derived.
- storage type: How the item is stored (array/object).
- unique properties: an array of properties to be erased when exporting to code.

*exportables_export_id($type, $id, $indent = '')*
---------------------------
Exports an object given it's type and ID.
Returns a string which is the export (usually the export of an array or object)*.
The string is indented by $indent amount.

*exportables_export_machine($type, $machine, $indent = '')*
---------------------------
Exports an object given it's type and machine-readable name.
Returns a string which is the export (usually the export of an array or object)*.
The string is indented by $indent amount.

*exportables_sync($type = '')*
---------------------------
Synchronizes the in-code version to the database. By default, syncs all items, however you can pass in a string to select the type of item to synchronize or an array for multiple types.
It does this by retrieving the ID matched to the machine name of the in-code item.
If that exists, then it compares the database version of the item to the previously stored in-code item and if they are the same, it updates them.
If the ID doesn't exist, then it creates a new item.


*exportables_machine_get($type, &$object)*
---------------------------
Returns the machine-readable name of an object given the type and object itself. Additionally adds $object->machine and sets it to the machine name of the object.

*exportables_machine_load_id($type, $machine)*
---------------------------
Gets a machine-readable name given object and type.

Taxonomy Exportables
===========================

*hook_taxonomy_default_vocabularies()*
---------------------------
Returns an array of vocabularies exported with *exportables_export*
