README for Exportables 1.x for Drupal 6.x
===========================

Warning
---------------------------
Exportables is currently a proof-of-concept module -- it should
be of interest only to developers and reckless Drupal enthusiasts
If you're looking for something to use on your production site,
you'd best bookmark and come back later.

Installation
---------------------------
Place the entirety of this directory in sites/all/modules/exportables

Navigate to *Administer » Site Building » Modules*. Enable the Exportables module.

Usage
---------------------------
This module is a utility which helps export items from the database into code and sync them back to the database.
The module was born out of a need for the [Features module](http://drupal.org/project/features) to export more than just items which currently have exportable hooks.
The module has no interface, and I have no intent to ever write an interface, because it's a module to facilitate code.
To export an item, call *exportables_export_id*, passing the item type (for example, *taxonomy_vocabulary*), and the ID.
The function returns a string, which is the exported code for that item.
You can put those in the hook definition for that type (in the case of taxonomy vocabularies, *hook_taxonomy_default_vocabularies*), and they will be synchronized to the database.
Detailed information about the API, both in terms of hooks generated by the Exportables module and the use of the Exportables module itself can be fined in API.txt.

What's next?
---------------------------
Integration with the [Features module](http://drupal.org/project/features).
