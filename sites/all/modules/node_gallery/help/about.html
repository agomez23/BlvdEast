<h5>Module Overview</h5>
<p>
 Node Gallery enables users to create flexible and powerful image galleries that
 are fully integrated with Drupal's node system.  Version 3.0 was rearchitected with performance in mind --
 Node Gallery will scale as far as Drupal's node module will. 
</p>
<p>
 At its heart, Node Gallery consists of one or more relationships that associate
 a "Gallery" node content type to an "Image" node content type.  The only requirement
 here is that the image content type have a CCK imagefield on it.  
</p>
<p>
 Once a relationship between two content types is established, the admin can 
 optionally change settings on a per-relationship basis, allowing greater flexibility.
 Users can then create galleries and upload images to those galleries.
 Because Images and Galleries are both node types, Node Gallery naturally
 integrates with Drupal core's taxonomy and comment module, and other powerful
 modules to enhance the gallery and its images (i.e. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">cck</a>, 
 <a href="http://drupal.org/project/flag">flag</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ubercart">ubercart</a>,
 <a href="http://drupal.org/project/fivestar">fivestar</a>, etc.) 
</p>
<p>
 If all this sounds complex, don't worry.  Node Gallery ships with everything you
 need to get started - 2 content types, a relationship, 3 imagecache presets, and
 a handful of views.  All of this is configured to work together out-of-the-box
 with sane defaults so that many users of the module will never have the need to ever
 change these default settings. Just know that they're there if you need to change them.
</p>
<h5>Node Gallery Features</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Uses <a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagefield">CCK imagefields</a> for image storage.</li>
  <li>Uses imagecache to create derivatives, allowing full customization of
      display resolutions and additional decorations.</li>
  <li>Tightly integrates with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> module for the retrieval 
      and display of images and galleries, allowing easy customization of design and logic.  Node Gallery
      also ships with quite a few default views to make it easier on the admin.</li>
  <li>Integration with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/plupload">plupload</a> module for
      easy bulk uploads using HTML 5, or Adobe Flash.</li>
  <li>Integration with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/jquery_ui">jQuery UI</a> module to allow
      customized per-gallery sorting through an easy drag &amp; drop workflow of image thumbnails, seamlessly
      degrading to Drupal table-drag or HTML form.</li>
  <li>Each gallery has a "Manage Images" tab that allows mass editing of user-configured fields on each image
      in the gallery to streamline workflow.</li>
  <li>Leverages Drupal's Batch API to operate on large amounts of images,
      guaranteeing high scalability and reliable operations.</li>
  <li>Engineered to be as effecient as possible with regards to memory and database load.  By utilizing caching
      methods, galleries with <em>thousands</em> of images still render quickly.</li>
  <li>An unlimited number of gallery relationships can be established, thus
      allowing administrators to setup both simple and complex galleries for
      their users to utilize.</li>
  <li>Per user albums.</li>
  <li>Views-based latest and random image blocks</li>
  <li>Token integration for customized file paths and links.</li>
  <li>Reliance on established modules provides automatic integration with the
      countless add-on modules for Views and CCK, such as
      <a href="http://drupal.org/project/filefield_paths">Filefield Paths</a> or
      <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_galleriffic">Views Galleriffic.</a>
  </li>
  <li>Optional add-on modules:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery_access">Node Gallery Access</a>: Provides password protected gallery access and integration with other access modules.</li>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery_hierarchy">Node Gallery Hierarchy</a>: Provides support for nested galleries.</li>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery_bulk_operations">Node Gallery Bulk Operations</a>: Integrates with
          <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_bulk_operations">Views Bulk Operations</a> to provide a Bulk Operations tab on
          each gallery.</li>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery_default">Node Gallery Default</a>: Creates and maintains default gallery for every user.</li>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery_jcarousel">Node Gallery JCarousel</a>: Provides an alternative jQuery jcarousel
          based image navigator.</li>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery_slideshow">Node Gallery Slideshow</a>: Provides a fully integrated jquery slideshow for galleries</li>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery_taxonomy">Node Gallery Taxonomy</a>: Cascades taxonomy changes made on a gallery
          to its image nodes.</li>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery_user_profile">Node Gallery User Profile</a>: Integrates a tab on profile pages
          displaying the users galleries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Optional integration with 3rd party modules:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/node/199254">Actions</a>: Actions are provided that change a gallery, toggle the cover image status, and change an image's weight. These integrate with Triggers and Rules.</li>
      <li>An API is available that implements webservices in JSON.</li>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/token">Token</a>: Node Gallery exposes several tokens to the token module</li>
      <li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagefield_import">Imagefield Import</a>: Import images in bulk via FTP/SCP from a directory on the server.</li>
      <li>Code changes have been made to make Node Gallery compatible with <a href="http://www.ubercart.org">Ubercart</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/og">Organic Groups(og)</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/realname">RealName</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Excellent help/documentation :)</li>
</ul>
