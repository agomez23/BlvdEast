 Node Gallery provides an image gallery for your site using two content types:
 a gallery type and an image type. Viewing a gallery node also displays the thumbnails of the
 image nodes that are contained within the gallery. Upon installation a default
 relationship, corresponding content types, imagecache presets, and default views are created automatically, so you
 can start creating galleries and uploading images right away.
