Overview --
Resizable Body allows you to resize the body and comment field for node types. You can 
alter the number of rows and columns for the textarea, hide the grippie bar that 
appears or have automatic height adjustment for the textarea.

You can also hide the 'split summary at cursor' button that could potentially confuse 
some users.

Installation --
1/ Install the module as normal. 

2/ New form inputs will appear inside the "Resizing options" fieldset inside 
the submission form settings and the comments field if enabled:

 * A select to choose how the body field should be resizable, None, With 
 grippie, Automatically without animation, Auto with animation.
 * Textfields to specify how many rows and cols should be used for the 
 field .
 * Checkbox to remove the 'split summary at cursor'.
